## Getting started

If you just want to get started go to the [setup document](/docs/setup.md) for the 'real deal'.

## What is MoNA

This project was made as an all-included foundation for building Next.js web applications with TypeScript.

First-clas developer experience, security, speed, offline-first and compliance is the core behind MoNA.

When starting this project, I had a very clear goal:

> I want to make _excellent_ web applications **fast**

This template project would then be built on tons of great software with OSS licenses, and I want to give back and help as much as possible...

That's why I decided to make this starter kit but differently, from other kits I've tried; it should be based on certain core aspects from the beginning.

- Internationalization
- Agreed upon/widely used practices
- Great theming
- GraphQL
- Security
- Performance
- Automation
- First-class developer experience
- Teamwork

This kit may not be the answer to every need you have...

And there'll (hopefully) always be different needs, so here's a list of what MoNA is **not**:

- It's not a static site generator
- It's not made with REST in mind
- It's not 100% secure and safe from hackers - **remember to research and implement the security strategies needed for your application**
